<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes what data the Mini Task Manager Application
collects and how it is used. The application stores tasks and related data on a
database configured for the app (SQLite in development; optionally PostgreSQL or
SQL Server in production). This page explains the specific types of data the
application handles and relevant user controls.</p>

<h2>Data Collected by the Application</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Task records:</strong> Each task contains `Title`, optional
    `Description`, optional `DueDate`, and `IsCompleted` flag. These are stored
    in the application's database and displayed in the Tasks views.</li>
    <li><strong>Database metadata:</strong> EF Core migration history and any
    schema or system metadata needed to operate the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Application logs:</strong> Server-side logs (errors, warnings,
    informational messages) used to operate and debug the application. Logs may
    include timestamps and request metadata but do not intentionally contain
    sensitive task contents unless an error includes them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where Data Is Stored</h2>
<p>During development the app uses a local SQLite file (MiniTaskManager.db).
In production the app expects a connection string named `DefaultConnection` —
you may configure PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite. Connection strings are
read from configuration or environment variables (e.g. `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`).</p>

<h2>Cookies and Client Storage</h2>
<p>The application uses standard ASP.NET Core session and antiforgery
mechanisms if enabled. It also uses Bootstrap and jQuery (client-side only).
The site itself does not set profiling or advertising cookies by default.
Browser controls can be used to manage cookies.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The project includes third-party libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, EF Core).
If you configure additional third-party services (analytics, email, storage),
those services may collect data according to their own policies — you are
responsible for reviewing and configuring those services.</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>Task data is retained until deleted by the user or removed from the
database. If you need data removed, delete tasks from the UI or request
assistance via the contact email below.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Access to the database and production secrets should be secured by the
deployment environment (connection strings in environment variables, secure
access controls). The application does not implement authentication by
default — if you add authentication, follow best practices for password and
credential storage.</p>

<h2>Your Rights & Contact</h2>
<p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of data stored by this
application. Contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@example.com">privacy@example.com</a></p>

<p>If you need the policy tailored for a deployed environment (e.g., when you
enable authentication or add analytics), tell me which features you plan to
enable and I will update this policy accordingly.</p>
